					<strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong>
				</div>
				<div className="my-2">
					CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
					websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law&apos;s
					reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or
					company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates
					websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from
					California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its
					website stating exactly the information being collected and those
					individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.
				</div>
				<div className="my-2">
					<strong>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</strong>
				</div>
				<div className="my-2">Users can visit our site anonymously.</div>
				<div className="my-2">
					Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our
					home page or, at a minimum, on the first significant page after
					entering our website.
				</div>
				<div className="my-2">
					Our Privacy Policy link includes the word &apos;Privacy&apos; and can
					easily be found on the page specified above.

					<strong>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</strong>

					We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use

				</div>
				<div className="my-2">
					<strong>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</strong>

					<strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong>
				</div>
				<div className="my-2">
					When it comes to the collection of personal information from children
					under the age of 13 years old, the Children&apos;s Online Privacy
					Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade
					Commission, United States&apos; consumer protection agency, enforces
					the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online
					services must do to protect children&apos;s privacy and safety online.
				</div>
				<div className="my-2">
					We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years

					<strong>Fair Information Practices</strong>
				</div>
				<div className="my-2">
					The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy
					law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a
					significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
					globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how
					they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various
					privacy laws that protect personal information.
				</div>
				<div className="my-2">
					<strong>
						In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take
						the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
					</strong>
				</div>
				<div className="ml-8 my-2 list-disc">
					<ul>
						<li>We will notify you via email within 7 business days</li>
						<li>
							We will notify the users via in-site notification within 7
							business days
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div className="my-2">
					We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which requires that
					individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights
					against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.
					This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable
					rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to
					courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute
					non-compliance by data processors.

					<strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong>

				<div className="my-2">
					The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email,

					tough penalties for violations.

				<div className="my-2">
